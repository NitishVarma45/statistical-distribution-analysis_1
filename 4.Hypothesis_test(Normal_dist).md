Objective:
The objective of this stage is to formally evaluate whether the height data of high school students is consistent with a Normal distribution using statistical hypothesis testing and diagnostic plots.

Statistical Hypothesis:
Based on domain knowledge and exploratory data analysis, a Normal distribution is proposed as a candidate model for the height data.
Null Hypothesis (H₀):
The height data follows a Normal distribution.
Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):
The height data does not follow a Normal distribution.

The goal of hypothesis testing is not to prove normality, but to assess whether there is sufficient statistical evidence to reject the assumption of normality.

Significance Level:
All hypothesis tests are conducted at a significance level of:
α=0.05
This represents a 5% probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true (Type I error).

RESULT:
Based on exploratory analysis, a Normal distribution was proposed as a candidate model for the height data. This hypothesis was evaluated using Q–Q plots and the Kolmogorov–Smirnov goodness-of-fit test. At the 5% significance level, the null hypothesis was rejected.
i.e The data given doesn't follow normal distribution.
