Objective:
The objective of this stage is to formally evaluate whether the height data of high school students is consistent with a Log-normal distribution using statistical hypothesis testing and diagnostic plots.

Statistical Hypothesis:
Given the observed right-skewness in the data, a Log-normal distribution is proposed as a candidate model for the height data.
Null Hypothesis (H₀):
The height data follows a Log-normal distribution.
Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):
The height data does not follow a Log-normal distribution.

The goal of hypothesis testing is not to prove log-normality, but to assess whether there is sufficient statistical evidence to reject the assumption of log-normality.

Significance Level:
All hypothesis tests are conducted at a significance level of:
α=0.05
This represents a 5% probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true.

RESULT:
Based on exploratory analysis, a Log-normal distribution was proposed as a candidate model due to the presence of mild positive skewness in the data. This hypothesis was evaluated by applying normality tests to the logarithm of the height data and by examining the corresponding Q–Q plots. At the 5% significance level, the null hypothesis was rejected.
i.e., the given height data does not follow a Log-normal distribution.
